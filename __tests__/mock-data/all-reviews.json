  "blurb": "Borderlands 3 is an action role-playing first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It is the sequel to 2012's Borderlands 2, and the fourth main entry in the Borderlands series. Borderlands 3 was released on 13 September 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and on 30 October 2019 for Apple macOS. A Stadia port was released on 17 December 2019. Players complete quests and side missions, in single-player or multiplayer, as one of four classes. When killed, enemies may drop weapons and gear which can be equipped. New abilities are unlocked as the player gains experience. Unlike previous games, the levels of Borderlands 3 take place on multiple planets. The plot is centered around stopping the cult-leading twins, Troy and Tyreen Calypso, from harnessing the power of the alien Vaults spread across the galaxy. <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_3\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "Borderlands 3 is The Family Circus by way of Spencer's Gifts, a game with long, earnest quests about how darn good coffee is punctuated by gore and gun violence. Borderlands 3 walks by dog poop, points at it, and laughs, and then sets it on fire. Borderlands 3 stays up until 11:30 pm drinking soda and googling crass Flash animations, taking detailed notes. It's stuck in the late '00s, when surface level vulgarity was enough to qualify as edgy—Borderlands 3 is seriously obsessed with turds—and when the series was first conceived. It's stuck in a time when memes lasted months rather than days, when referential humor was still a novelty and not exhausting, when you could point at something the slightest bit abnormal or gross and call it a joke. Simpler times, not necessarily better times. Our distance from the era Borderlands 3 evokes makes it feel like a retro shooter rather than alive and present in modern humor and pop culture. It's simultaneously repulsive and compulsive, an FPS RPG that excels when its weapon generation system spits out guns that feels great to shoot, adorned with broken attributes capable of turning hordes of goons, bugs, and soldiers into clouds of red mist, elemental particles, explosions, and big damage numbers.  Then it tells one of its many long, bad jokes and the cloud dissipates. I have horrific whiplash.  With Borderlands 3, a few things have changed, but to little effect. It's still a Diablo-like masquerading as a shooter, now with new traversal moves, gorgeous gun models, and improved weapon feedback. But Gearbox has done little to build on the Borderlands formula, while chucking the pitch perfect writing of Tales from the Borderlands in the bin. It's the best and the worst of the series at once. Skagological Tales from the Borderlands proved that the Borderlands universe could balance goofy slapstick comedy with great character work, gracefully swaying between fourth-wall breaking gags about videogame clichés and heartfelt drama. It irreversibly changed what I expect from the series.  But Borderlands 3 opts for a best-of approach, something like a sitcom clip show. The new space travel setup takes the player on a tour of the galaxy in search of yet more vaults, each stop an excuse to roll out an old character only for them to disappear or fade into the background as soon as they say hello, shoot some folks, and crack a few one-liners in sidequests that do little to reveal anything about them or test them in any way.  Most don't change or press on the main narrative in vital ways, functioning as conduits for strained laughs or the rare serious moment, but rarely both. Some even disappear for good, with little ceremony or reflection. It's as if I'm meant to come to Borderlands 3 with a preexisting deep affection for them all, and just seeing them should be enough to win my heart. The new big bads, the Calypso Twins, are murderous livestreamers whose motives and histories only become clear in the final act. Until then, they're just two cartoon villains who take up beef with the vault hunter, gunning to open the same vaults and collect the power within. There's not much more to them besides long, obnoxious monologues about how much I suck. Even as a parody of livestreamers, they offer no cultural commentary. They're just shitty, power hungry people who will do anything to rule the universe.  Borderlands 3 reads like teenage lunch table improv circa Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Glimmers of heart are buried deep. I dug the cute relationship between Sir Hammerlock, a charming interplanetary big game hunter, and his new boyfriend on Eden-6, and the fiery spirit of a young, new adventurer studying under Maya, but there are few genuine jokes, dramatic beats, or interesting character moments in Borderlands 3.  A few quests: I collect brown rock specimens (poop) for a guy obsessed with brown rock specimens (poop), Claptrap needs help building a 'friend' who is clearly a feminine robot for his creepy private purposes, I plant dynamite in a massive poop dam to save a farm, I help a guy open a burger joint while he yells about burgers a lot, I help a guy escape from a porta-potty for a poop-spewing rocket launcher—it's borderline unbearable. There's a quest-giver who does their best Tommy Wiseau impression and talks about making movies, which is the whole 20-minute long punchline—the joke is simply knowing who he is. Another makes fun of exploitative microtransactions and buggy early access games with a boring quest that forced me to either spend in-game cash for an easy skip or perform tedious tasks. It goes on for so long that I gladly would've paid real money to skip it. Like many Borderlands bits, it's a joke that could've been a two-minute gag extended to 10 times that. My favorite quests were the least chatty and most shooty, a rarity, as the bulk of Borderlands 3 reads like teenage lunch table improv circa Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me.  Worse, there's no way to skip through the dialogue. Quests lurch into motion like an old car: listen to an NPC talk for 30 seconds, press a button as if twisting the ignition, more talking, more heaving of the engine, pick up an object, more talking, spit, putter, and now the objective location is revealed. And we're off.  Worst, I ran into a handful of scripting bugs where bits of dialogue repeated endlessly and quests became impossible to complete without restarting the game. Seeing markers for multiple quests at the same time isn't possible either. The inventory system is largely unchanged. Borderlands 3 is a bundle of aged design and frustrating inefficiencies.  Borderlands ran like a dream at 2560x1440 on my souped up PC, maintaining 90-plus fps with a few dips when loading in new areas and during particularly chaotic combat scenarios. For the complete picture, here's our Borderlands 3 performance review.  The new locations are a welcome change of scenery from the muted deserts of Pandora, though it's still home to the most zones and where I spent the most time throughout the campaign. Eden-6 is your typical swampy jungle, where fire-breathing dinos and club-wielding, shit-tossing jabbers chased me around swamps and through the treetops. Promethea is a slick corporate dystopia composed of uniformly branded architecture and neon lighting.  A few surprise locations mix things up further, though most environments are still a few open areas with branching corridors. Borderlands' signature comic book style hasn't changed much, but it looks significantly sharper in 2019, with characters and sweeping vistas that communicate scale and personality clearer than ever.  Each location has its own enemy types, but in practice there's not much difference between fighting a swarm of COV soldiers spawning in from all directions or a swarm of bandits spawning in from all directions. Borderlands 3 usually tests players with a mess of enemies in open, multi-tiered arenas, more of a war of attrition than a tactical puzzle. Besides a few tough bosses, the true challenge came from deciding whether to shelve a badass electro-pistol that basically functioned as a super shotgun or a fiery SMG that shot bullets in a heart-shaped pattern for a plain weapon with an elemental damage affinity better suited to a region's enemy type.  Corrosive dissolves armor, electric damage melts shields, and fire burns flesh. Radiation damage makes enemies explode, which is always fun. I just tired of repeatedly killing my darlings (fun guns) for lesser darlings (boring guns which are technically better for the situation). Trying new weapons is part of Borderlands' appeal, but there can be huge droughts between the truly good ones until the endgame. Wild gear is the reason to play Borderlands 3, and the guns, as expected, are its fervently beating heart. I'm partial to the Tediore SMGs. Rather than reload them, you toss 'em out and a new one materializes in your hands. I had one that would sprout legs and fire a few rockets before exploding after being tossed. My favorite shotgun chains electric damage to all nearby enemies, deleting the room's shields and dissolving handfuls of weaker enemies at once. Jakobs sniper rifles are ornate, gilded works of art, less playful but extremely lethal. I found a legendary that, if I land a headshot, will ricochet and pop another guy's head in the room. The view-models are gorgeous too, ranging from chunky, volatile machinery to egg-shaped flawless future tech. Guns whir and spin up and little pieces kick around as they fire, some smoke, some sigh, and some whine like a VCR mid-rewind. I've yet to tire of watching loot rain down from defeated enemies, the signal light for something I haven't seen before. Wild gear is the reason to play Borderlands 3, and the guns, as expected, are its fervently beating heart.  As expected, it's better with friends, though the extra enemies and explosions run counter to the shooting refinements. With so much visual noise against a mess of flat colors and thick lines, I often can't see what I'm pointing at, making well-aimed critical shots an act of faith rather than intent and skill.  Enemies react better to getting shot and now we can crouch-slide and ground pound and the guns look and feel much more like actual machines instead of cardboard DPS dispensers—and yet, combat still devolves into the same rhythms as the previous games. Enemies are too dumb and erratic and spongy to force tactical play. The most reliable plan: jump around, throw all the grenades, lay down on the fire button, use my Action Skill the second it recharges, and take cover only when necessary. It's good lizard-brain fun.  Borderlands 3's new vault hunters don't break much new ground either. While they each have three diverse skill trees and accompanying Action Skills perfect for squads looking to complement one another, there's nothing in the combat that requires close cooperation between classes as of yet, despite the inclusion of some context-sensitive ping tools. Calling out targets and pointing out loot locations is easy.  Moze summons a mech for some ridiculous damage-dealing, Amara is a siren with ghostly arms great for crowd control and AOE attacks, while Zane can summon a drone, shield, or decoy for more technical play. I spent the most time as FL4K, a robot with a pet companion, a great option for solo players.  My build turns the Skag into a  nightmare. Wherever he spawns, a radioactive explosion. Wherever he walks, enemies trail as he tanks them in a cloud of poison. Goons explode like bloody pustules in his wake, limbs whirling around a singularity while I—wearing a horse head and an American flag skin—fire rockets and toss grenades into the mess. This is what I love about Borderlands. I found it, beneath the thick sediment of poop jokes. Borderlands 3's skill trees produce Jackson Pollock vault hunters, spatterings of light and sound, where disorder is the point. I do this for around 30 hours, and while the novelty wanes the inherently repetitive action is propped by an endless font of cool guns, grenades, class mods, artifacts, and shields, each with their own ridiculous attributes. If Destiny 2's guardians are architectural blueprints with structure and purpose, Borderlands 3's skill trees produce Jackson Pollock vault hunters, spatterings of light and sound, where disorder is the point.  Once I finished the campaign, swept up the majority of side quests, and hit the level cap—something like 30 hours of play—when the NPCs quit talking and the focus returned to ruining hordes of enemies and finding more efficient weapons to do it with, I settled into a comfortable routine and remembered why I have hundreds of hours logged in Borderlands 2.  The clouds of red mist and particle effects returned, the numbers grew, and so too did my heart. The endgame had arrived.  Sadly, the endgame is pretty shallow at launch. It's all about accumulating better loot, but I'm a bit backed into a corner. Mayhem mode modifies enemy difficulty for better rewards with three levels to work through. Think of Diablo 3's difficulty levels: juice the challenge to earn better loot until it's no longer difficult, juice it yet again for better loot. I'd say ad infinitum, but there are only three Mayhem levels at launch.  The alternative is True Vault Hunter Mode, which kicks off a new campaign with all your loot and abilities in tow. Good in theory, I just never want to play the campaign again. A few repeatable timed gauntlets and waved-based horde modes are my only alternative, so I'll just wait for the DLC and hope the writing is better. Between the bugs, the extended non-jokes, the self-aggrandizing jabs at game design trends, and a few cameos I won't spoil but that made me audibly groan, Borderlands 3 has a lot in common with Gearbox fan events as of late. There's a lot of loud, extended posturing while holding what everyone really came for hostage. It's a shame, because Tales from the Borderlands found a delicate balance of absurdity, self-awareness, and genuine heart. A better Borderlands is possible, it's just not Borderlands 3. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/borderlands-3-review\"><i>Taken from PCGamer.com</i></a>",

  "blurb": "Days Gone is a 2019 action-adventure survival horror video game developed by SIE Bend Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.    Set in a post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after the start of a global pandemic, former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers the possibility of his wife Sarah still being alive, which leads Deacon on a quest to find her. Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective, in which the player can explore an open world environment. Players can use firearms, melee weapons and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers. A major game mechanic is Deacon's motorcycle, which is used as the player character's primary mode of transportation as well as mobile inventory.\r\n  <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_Gone\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "I have been on a journey with Days Gone. Both in terms of the hero, Deacon St. John’s, life, and the game itself - a rambling tale of zombie killing in an open world that can easily top 60 hours if you want to see everything. It’s a scrappy but satisfying adventure I’ve enjoyed despite minor bugs and a design that’s obviously been shuffled and cut during its two month delay. There’s a story that’s all over the place, while the game’s key feature - its 100+ strong monster hordes - are an impressive and terrifying spectacle, but not quite the trap-triggering set pieces originally revealed. There are obvious edits, and hot glue seams joining the bits throughout, especially in the first act. But despite that it’s still a big, engaging adventure that’s fun as a whole - enthusiastic and eager to please overall, even if the moment to moment parts don’t always connect smoothly.     First up those bugs. It’s a lot of little things really: nothing unplayable, more grumbling irritations like audio drop outs (silent bikes, say), weird AI moments, animation or collision glitches and framerate drops. For the most part it’s never ruined the experience for me, more chipped away at the polish. Those 60+ hours I’ve played come in part from finishing it (a good 40 odd hours if you’re not rushing) and the rest because I’ve enjoyed it. The post-end game especially. When you’ve unlocked high level skills and weapons it’s a zombie horde-massacring blast. That said, the game’s had four patches before release and I’m not entirely sure what state it’s in, or going to be.

This post viral outbreak world is part Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, part Far Cry 5 and part The Last of Us, weaving its mechanics into an experience that is as entertaining as it is, admittedly, unoriginal. There’s a solid progression system as you complete jobs and missions to earn trust with various survivor settlements, unlocking gear, crafting recipes, skills and weapons. That’s the core journey: in-game you progress from a working-to-live drifter, to developing community ties and putting down roots that give you something to fight for. While as a player you change from an opportunistic and cautious survivor to grizzled world beating pro with smarts you’ve earned along the way.     The main monsters aside from people [philosophical chin scratching...] are the Freakers - a mutated (and very alive) human, infected by a rabies-like virus. Early game even a single one is a thing to fear. You don’t have the gear or expertise to really take one on, and just two or three getting your scent is probably game over. As a result, you’ll be creeping cautiously around forests hoping for stealth kills at the start, terrified of every leafy noise in the distance. Later, though, you’ll be tooled up and taking on groups of them, gathered in hundred strong hordes with barely a thought, having learned how they work and how to win. It’s the kind of gradual, satisfying growth that evolves without being obvious until you look back and see how far you’ve come.    Horde games Even when you’re high level and packing the best gear, hordes are always daunting and terrifying in equal measure. Seeing them scream, as hundreds of clawing, frenzied monsters flow over cars or around buildings like a bucket of grasping hands splashed into the world never gets old. However, they are just sort of scattered around the open map - in caves dotted around the map, or picking at mass graves - with almost no explanation or intent. A few places have a scattering of explosive barrels and trucks to help thin them out, but otherwise it’s generally a case of placing bombs, throwing molotovs and then back peddling and hoping for the best. It’s a far cry from the carefully orchestrated trap-filled, set pieces originally revealed. Only one place - the red barn sawmill of the original 2016 E3 demo - features any of the barriers, doors and traps you can trigger to stem the flow of creatures. Although those are never mentioned or explained, and I set most of them off accidentally wondering why there were prompts hanging in the air. Deacon only even discusses the barest concepts of horde tactics right at the end of the game. By which point I’d learned all I needed to know wondered why I was basically getting a tutorial chat on horde management some 50 hours in.      That sense of things maybe not being in quite the right place also applies to the story. The opening has a strange start with no clear or overriding objective for the first few hours. Instead there’s just a collection of ‘Storylines’ that have you completing jobs for survivor camps. The Storyline system crosses and blends progression so that completing one goal can advance multiple questlines, while some things can stop for no clear reason until you finish doing another job not obviously connected. It is confusing. The very first mission, ‘Chasing Leon’ hangs at 50% for ages even when you have the required item and can wave it frantically in the face of the person who wants it, possible while yelling ‘I have iiiiiit. It’s right here’. To actually complete it you have to finish another mission on the other side of the map, that then unlocks an option to resolve it by making a choice with no clear payoff (despite the claim of making a significant decision). Elsewhere, an event that ultimately drives the first act to completion somehow manages to take barely days but also several weeks at the same time depending on whether you’re measuring by its internal plot time, or by the other required missions that happen in-between. It’s a beginning that feels reconstructed rather than intended, with steps artificially extended by breaks or oddly tiny increments (a couple of mission beats involve little more than a lengthy journey across the map for a single sentence of dialogue).     Plot points Persist, however, and things coalesce: a new area of the map opens up (and, much later, another area again) and clearer purpose develops. It almost feels like a TV series that doesn’t find its direction until the second season - as you move to new places narrative strands get weighter, better tied together and something more approaching a plot develops. The mid to late game has some likeable, interesting characters and antagonists, and sows enough seeds for some emotional investment to pay off. Although I’d argue it never really settles on an actual ‘main’ goal until almost the final few hours. It also pulls an almost cartoonish and childish fake out with the only high stakes plot choice it makes in the finale. I’m still weirdly angry about it because something that felt irreversible, and meaningful as a result, turns almost into an ‘it was all a dream’ level of joke.      Through all this Deacon is a conflicting character. He’s likeable and funny for the most part as he interacts, quips and wisecracks with the supporting cast. When it works Sam Witwer’s performance has an easy going charm up there with Nolan North or Troy Baker. But the character is also prone to bouts of callous and unrepentant hatred, murderous aggression or outright brutality that can grate against the lighter moments. Largely because the nebulous story structure can see situations switch on a dime, stripping key moments of the momentum needed to back them up, as the emotional makeup of the man changes as if by button press to suit the story. Sometimes it feels like you literally sat on the remote and changed channels accidentally. It’s also worth mentioning that if people struggle accepting Nathan Drake’s actually killed hundreds people, they are going to lose their shit when Deac‘ commits literal war crimes and borderline terrorism. Twice.     The wheel game    There’s another ‘main’ character to consider and that’s the bike, Deacon’s transport through all this. After so many video game horses dutifully following, or coming when called, it takes a little getting used to remembering where you parked, or needing fuel just to move (you also can’t save or fast travel unless you’re near your bike). It’s different, but the motorbike is every bit a tool for you to use, which also grows with you. You upgrade it, decorate it, learn how best to use it and, at this stage, I’m very attached to ‘my’ bike: cherry red, armored grills, flame decals on the gas tank. It helps that Days Gone is a beautiful place to ride through too, with an atmospheric world to take on that rolls on for miles. It’s perfect for long rides - the varied mountains of Oregon evocative in the rain, serene in the snow and exciting as thunder rolls across the sky.     Days Gone’s world is very much greater than the sum of it parts. It’s haphazard nature wouldn’t have survived on a smaller scale, but this is a substantial thing. The story can be spotty, and the gameplay glitchy, but over tens of hours it evens out. It’s easier to forgive a scattered narrative and occasional Freaker standing ankle deep in asphalt when you can spend hours exploring, discovering, or fighting through what it has to offer. It’s open world has enough surprises and depths to penetrate that I always found it enjoyable and full of memorable stories. Like the first time I ran out of fuel (rookie mistake) and crept through the forest at night looking for gas, terrified of every howl and shuffle in the trees. Or the time I discovered a horde by turning my torch on in a cave and finding 50 pale faces staring back at me. Those are the moments that stick with me, despite everything else. This may not hit the heights of recent Sony efforts like God of War or Spider-Man, but it suffers more from that expectation than it does its own rough edges.    <a href=\" https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/days-gone-review/\"><i>Taken from gamesradar </i></a>",

  "blurb": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt and based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, played in an open world with a third-person perspective. Players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter (known as a witcher) who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt, an otherworldly force determined to capture her and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game.  <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "With the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red’s saga has grown into something magnificent. It’s a game of truly epic scale that still displays an eye for every minute detail. It’s one that sees its hero, Geralt of Rivia, fully transformed from the sword-swinging Mr Loverman of the first game into a mature, reflective hero, and one where story, systems, art, music, action and lore all seem to mesh together into one dazzling whole. It’s the best fantasy RPG of its type since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and sets a new benchmark for the genre. To be honest, that’s all you really need to know.    All the same, you’re probably expecting more from a review than breathless hyperbole. Well, imagine a game that takes everything you love from The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings, Skyrim, The Legend of Zelda from Ocarina of Time to Twilight Princess and Red Dead Redemption. That’s pretty much Wild Hunt. With the third Witcher, CD Projekt Red is playing in the very biggest leagues.    The Red Dead comparison might seem strange, but there’s something about Wild Hunt’s free-roaming gameplay that keeps bringing Rockstar’s western masterpiece to mind. It’s not just that Geralt spends a large proportion of the game on horseback – his faithful steed, Roach, rarely further than a whistle away – but that the focus on exploring the wilderness, discovering characters and missions gives it a similar kind of feel. Both games share a dark, cynical tone leavened by sardonic humour and a dash of hope. Both are tales of killers who, in some sense, yearn to be something more.    Wild Hunt has almost endless possibilities, but it’s smart enough not to swamp you with them all at once. The initial section of the game threatens to hit you with the same mild disappointment you felt when you discovered that Dragon Age: Inquisition wasn’t doing one seamless world, but a series of linked, large-scale landscapes. Even Wild Hunt’s starter area is packed with story missions, beasts to slay and side quests, on a map we would have called huge ten years ago, but it feels a little constrained. Is this what an open world Witcher really means?    Yet CD Projekt Red is just getting you used to the systems; to finding noticeboards and taking on pest-control contracts, to getting from A to B on horseback and discovering what perils and hidden treasures lie en-route. You’re being eased into the game’s combat – fast, smart and tactical – and into its research and crafting: two things that other games make a chore, but Wild Hunt makes an integral part of the fun.    There’s been a lot of talk recently amongst the gaming literati about whether systems engage players more than storyline, but Wild Hunt binds the two together in ways that make the question seem nonsensical. Geralt has evolved from a surly young blade to a would-be father figure, on the trail of the woman he once loved and the closest thing they have to offspring.    To find them, he’ll have to battle men, beasts, spirits and otherworldly forces, while getting involved in intrigues that affect the fate of nations, yet it’s always clear what you’re doing and how it contributes to your aims overall. And if that means collecting herbs to brew potions to give you a fighting chance of taking on a murderous griffin, then that’s something you’re willing to do.    Even levelled up, Geralt is a professional rather than a superhero. While you can win some battles just by wading in, hacking away and dodging quickly, you’re more likely to succeed if you go in prepared, stocked with potions and with your target’s weaknesses in mind. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Wild Hunt is how it makes light work of its most mundane elements.    It still has the classic hook of every RPG – fighting monsters to gain experience and loot to level up and upgrade to make you even better at fighting monsters – but it has other pleasures too, with incredible scope for exploration and quests that are well-scripted, varied and full of personality. Your faithful steed works brilliantly both as a transport and as a means of charging headlong into combat, and even here the game shows intelligence, both by limiting its effectiveness in battle through a fear gauge, and in having what’s effectively a cruise mode for gently cantering along the paths.    Yet it’s just when you think you’re getting the measure of it that Wild Hunt pulls the veil away, then tells you that you ain’t seen nothing yet. This still isn’t quite one single open world, but the largest areas are so huge that it effectively doesn’t matter, and each one comes crammed with so many story quests, side quests and incidents that you’ll spend half your time trying to prioritise what to tackle next.    And while you’ll be happy to spend hours trotting through the scenery on horseback, the fast travel options that seemed unnecessary in the prologue section now seem vital. Ditto for boats – an essential for getting from the main landmass to explore far-off islands. Words like sprawling and massive don’t do The Witcher 3 justice.    There’s a real balance here, too, between the narrative-led gameplay and the more explorative, emergent stuff. The story missions don’t simply take you from one point on the map to the next, but give you threads to tease out and follow, so that you’re always in touch with the central storyline no matter where you are.    The only limitation comes down to your current level – each quest and side-quest has a recommended level, and we’ve found that you ignore these at your peril. Yet when Wild Hunt does put you on a story mission, it feels as detailed and cinematic as any linear action game. Dialogue scenes, set-piece action sequences and boss battles all seem to flow naturally into the gameplay, with a potency we haven’t always seen in previous Witcher games.    It’s held together by great music, strong voicework and an impressive consistency of tone. Fantasy doesn’t get much darker than it does in Wild Hunt, where the ongoing war between empires is constantly in the background, where the ordinary folk are clearly suffering, injustice runs rampant, and even a hero must sometimes turn a blind eye.    That doesn’t mean you can’t make a difference. There’s a real feeling that what you say and what you do is changing things for worse or better, even if it’s simply clearing a farmstead or a small port of monsters and letting the locals get back to their grubby, impoverished lives.    The visuals, meanwhile, are just astonishing. The game’s landscapes are epic, atmospheric and believable, making superb use of vegetation, light, fog, cloud and colour. It’s the kind of game where you want to explore for the scenery alone. Yet the up-close detail is equally impressive, with textures and surfaces you can almost feel and facial animation that leaves Dragon Age: Inquisition’s in the dust.    Wild Hunt delivers a world of magic that you can believe in and characters you can believe in too. And if the series’ predeliction for dubious sexy stuff hasn’t gone away entirely, at least the needless cleavage and soft-porn groping doesn’t look so ridiculous or Thunderbirds-like this time around.    Causes for complaint are spectacularly few and far between. CD Projekt has done a fabulous job of all the basics, from inventory and quest management to crafting, that the interface barely bogs you down, but two steps to get to the map screen seems one step too far. Loading times are a little on the long side, though only a problem when you die or use fast-travel, and the frame rate falters occasionally on the PS4 version tested, particularly when you’re wandering around the world’s big cities.    Speaking personally, I’m also not a huge fan of having to repair weapons regularly, and having to travel back to the nearest blacksmith to get my gear fixed up is one chore I could do without. Still, repair kits are easily available, and some people like that sort of authenticity. In fact, Wild Hunt makes it palatable by placing accessible limited-time weapon and armour buffs for you to use while you’re there. In short, I’m only sweating about the smallest small stuff.    And that’s just silly. The big stuff here is absolutely brilliant – and brilliant in a way that leaves you wishing that more games could be both this ambitious and this well executed without failing one way or the other. Sure, The Witcher 2 isn’t something you can pick up casually, requiring time, commitment and – well, a lot more time – but it’s hard to imagine anyone without a hatred of RPGs and fantasy regretting the countless hours they’ll put in.    Verdict With commiserations to Bioware and Bethesda, Wild Hunt is the new RPG by which all other RPGs should be judged. Not only has CD Projekt Red deliverered the largest and most convincing fantasy open-world we’ve ever seen, but a storyline, quests and systems that make it an incredibly compelling place to run, ride and sail around in. It’s the most breathtaking time sink you’re likely to play this year.    <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt\"><i>Taken from Trusted Reviews</i></a>",

  "gameName": "Mass Effect 3",
  "tagline": "Take Earth Back: Break the Cycle",
  "blurb": "Mass Effect 3 is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. The final installment of the Mass Effect trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A Wii U version of the game, entitled Mass Effect 3: Special Edition, was later released in November 2012. Mass Effect 3 is set within the Milky Way Galaxy in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.  <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "Mass Effect was a space RPG about killing a flying robot god - a Reaper. Mass Effect 2 was about stopping one from being built. In Mass Effect 3, they've warped in from darkspace in their hundreds.    And that's all I'll say about the plot. This review will be spoiler-free even for those of you who've avoided the trailers and the demo.    In all three games, your time is split evenly between persuading people to help you and shooting people who won't. The original's strength was its main quest: a chase that felt both personally motivated and galactically important. Mass Effect 2's plot was muddled and brief, but livened up by an exotic cast of new characters with interesting side stories.    Mass Effect 3 tries for the best of both worlds: an urgent and galaxy-critical plot that directly involves the entire crowd of oddball personalities the series has built up. And it works.    Inside of 20 minutes, you have a crucial goal and a clear route to achieving it. And unlike the previous games, every sidequest and adventure along the way is connected to that. The war gives everyone a reason to need your help, and everyone you help has reason to join the war.    That brings you into contact with just about every familiar face from the previous games, each of whom gets at least one fan-pleasing moment of bravado or violence. But the most remarkable thing about them is what makes Mass Effect 3 unique: they could all be dead.    By the end of Mass Effect 2, only one of your 13 former squadmates is certain to be alive. Those who are each play a leading role in a subplot of Mass Effect 3. Those who aren't have their stories invisibly trimmed out or rewritten with new characters.    These newbies are not just bland stand-ins, either. In some cases, a friend's absence is filled by someone with a radically different motivation, and new relationships with the rest of the cast. A Turian squadmate summed up his feelings for one of these replacement characters mid fight:    \"I don't like him!\"    It's an extraordinarily complex, reactive and futuristic bit of storytelling, and it makes Mass Effect 3 personal and unique for anyone who has a history with the series. If you're starting fresh, the game assumes the death of a few characters whose stories make less sense to new players, and leaves the rest alive.     Other than the colourful, beautifully designed characters, one of the main treats of a Mass Effect game is the colourful, beautifully designed planets. The large-scale problems you're facing in this third outing make your mission a whistle-stop tour of the key races' home worlds, their glowing sci-fi dreamscapes in the process of being stomped on by mountain-sized robot lobsters. It's spectacular, and it feels like exploring the heart of the gorgeous galaxy you've been skirting all this time.    Each away-mission to these places is a substantial, satisfying fight against one of several different factions. The combat feels another notch more impactful than that of Mass Effect 2. The classes are stronger and more distinct: the Infiltrator bursts heads with every sniper rifle shot, the Vanguard can slam herself into enemies over almost any distance or obstacle, and the Adept flings crowds of enemies into the air and rips them apart with biotic combos.    You fine-tune these powers as you level up, deciding between, say, a longer cloak duration or the ability to use one power without revealing yourself. And the weapons you find and buy give you interestingly different compromises between fire rate and stopping force - tweaked further with mods.    But the most radical and effective change to the RPG side of combat is the ability to choose your own balance between weapons and abilities. Any class can now take one of each weapon type into a fight, but the more you carry, the slower your powers recharge.    I gave my Infiltrator a heavy shotgun, meaning she could use Cloak less often but deal a chunkier slam of damage when she struck. Trying an Adept, I shelved everything but a featherweight sub-machinegun, letting her wub out Singularities and Warp Fields every second. It finally feels like the class system has lost the last of its arbitrary restrictions, and you can create your own play style.     It all mixes well with your squadmate's powers. I liked to stealth behind enemy lines, hack their turrets, then let my biotic friend lift people out of cover to float them into range of their own subverted weapon. Once, a lifted soldier was pelted over to us by his own turret's fire, and my Cryo ammo power caused one of our shots to freeze him solid. He dropped to the ground and shattered. I felt like applauding.    The fights have also become more complex and less repetitive, thanks to a lot of smart interplay between enemy types. Some give each other armour or shielding, or feed on each other's corpses, or burst out of each other when you shoot the wrong sac. Huge, fast, melee-only Brutes force an alarming change of pace from cautious cover shooting. And the Banshee, a tall, spindly horror that teleports towards you as it shakes with rage, is properly traumatic to fight.    The best way to deal with all of this varies with the arena it's found in - something Mass Effect 2 never managed. It's the difference between dreading the next prolonged combat sequence and relishing it.    The low points of the combat are the bigger boss fights, which too often involve one- or two-shot kills that hit you almost instantly and seemingly at random. If you have no pride, and lord knows I don't, you can always jam the difficulty level down to its new 'Narrative' mode for a moment: it's designed for non-gamers who just want the story, so it makes you virtually invincible.    The only unfixable problem, boss-wise, is a recurring character who's scripted to survive and escape your first few encounters. It's always painful to watch someone fail to shoot the bad guy in a cutscene. When it's my Shepard, a character I love for prematurely ending conversations with a bullet, it's downright agony.     I'll get the other irritations over with now. The spacebar - previously only used for sprinting, ducking, taking cover, using switches, talking to people and vaulting over things - is now also used for diving away from cover too. It makes an already maddeningly imprecise system utterly ridiculous. At least half my deaths were from the spacebar not doing what I expected it to.    We're on PCs. We have 128 keys. We can handle a separate button for taking cover.    The multiplayer is a cooperative survival mode - you and your friends pick a class and fight off waves of enemies. It's not switched on at the time of writing, so I can't tell you how that plays beyond what you can try for yourself in the demo. But the way it affects the main game is needlessly problematic.    In singleplayer, everything you do accumulates 'war assets'. When you finish the game, how many of these you have determines how good an ending you get: how well the final fight goes for your side. Success in co-op multiplies your war assets, up to twice their normal value. That means that if you only play singleplayer, or want to finish singleplayer first, you'll have to grind the living hell out of its most tedious fetch quests to get the best ending.    These quests generally involve scouring the galaxy for a planet someone mentioned, scanning it, then returning to the Citadel. I did every proper quest I could find, but didn't play multiplayer and skipped most of these empty FedEx ones. The ending I got... I won't say how, but it could have gone a lot better.     In general, too, the end of the series is a mixed bag. Satisfying in some ways, nonsensical in others, and ultimately too simple. But the sheer scale of the adventure it's ending - and the music, which is gorgeous throughout - gives it an emotional impact that goes beyond its plot payload.    It left me feeling incredibly sad.    Shepard is the best game character I've ever played. She's been an ongoing improv collaboration between me and BioWare to build a hero that works for their plot, but suits my tastes. Since we composed her first inspiring speech to the crew when she took charge of the Normandy, a commanding, brutally effective woman has emerged through 60 hours of tough decisions. She's killed thousands who got in her way, hung up on the interstellar Council four times, punched the same reporter in three different interviews and shot people mid-sentence. But she has also formed conflicted, quiet, sometimes touching relationships with some of the alien weirdos dragged along on her mission. Relationships that gave her character a gentler side I didn't expect, but which made sense of the person I had in my head.    I'm thinking back through all that as the credits roll. At the end of them a box pops up. It says: \"you can continue to build Shepard's legend through further gameplay and downloadable content\" then reloads my last save.    So now I'm laughing instead.    <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/mass-effect-3-review/\"><i>Taken from PCGamer</i></a>",

  "blurb": "Burnout 3: Takedown is a racing video game developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. It is the third instalment in the Burnout series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series is the use of boost, earned through risky driving, to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in Burnout 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from standard circuit races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied with traffic. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer.  <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_3:_Takedown\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "It seems utter madness that a game of the quality of Burnout 2 wasn't a massive hit outside of Europe. Maybe it was Acclaim's ongoing inability to compete with the big guns in the US that was to blame, or maybe consumers weren't that convinced about the original and wrongly assumed the quick-fire sequel would be more of the same. They couldn't have been more wrong, and the fact that it still stands out as one of the best looking games and most addictive ever says a lot. Acclaim's loss was very much EA's gain, and if any games publisher in the world knows how to sell to the Yanks, it's EA. If Burnout 3 sells less than four times what its predecessor sold we'd be very surprised indeed.    Despite EA already having a best seller in the racing genre in Need For Speed Underground, it was a no-brainer for EA to sign Burnout 3. Criterion has, over the last three years, carved a category all of its own, featuring a crash-based all-action style of racing that no other game has come anywhere near to matching. The question that troubled hardcore followers of the series though was just how evident EA's paw prints would be on the game. Would it be diluted for the masses, or would the Brits hold out and stick to their guns?    The influence EA has had on Burnout 3's gestation cannot be underestimated, but rather than being forced it's a mutual appreciation. You can see it, hear it and feel it everywhere, but given Criterion's love for SSX it was undeniably a match made in heaven when EA jumped the queue and snapped up the rights to publish the game from under everyone else's noses. EA was so impressed it then bought the bloody company only a few months later in as canny a piece of games industry business as you'll ever see. Now not only does it have the world's best arcade racing developer, but the industry's leading middleware provider. All it needed was the game to match.    What did we expect from Burnout 3? More tracks, modes, cars, better graphics? Naturally. Online? Of course. Once EA inked that deal with Microsoft back at E3 we knew our Burnout 3 dreams were going to come true. We were fully excited, almost carried away with the idea of being able to translate the offline gameplay into six player racing, Party Crash and the rest. The only grey area was how long had Criterion been working on Live? Was it bolted on at the last minute? We'd been told in the past that there was definitelyno Live play. Not the ideal preparation for what, next to Halo 2 and PES 4, was the year's biggest Xbox Live offering. Nevertheless, how could anyone with access to PS2 or Xbox online gaming not feel a pang of excitement? The gameplay was so well suited to online multiplayer it would have been a heinous crime not to base the game around it.    But before we dive headlong into our online indulgence, it's important to acknowledge the fact that the vast majority of the people that buy this game will never play it online. Does that matter? Amazingly, no. For the thirty or so hours we were surgically attached to the TV playing this game, the vast majority of that was played offline on our own, unlocking all 100 crash junctions, attempting to battle through all 76 races and trying to scoop gold medals and headlines. It's an absolutely mammoth game, make no mistake.    Although there are the usual Single Event and Time Attack modes, World Tour is likely to be where you'll spend most of your time. Crash Junctions or Races are accessed via global Sat Nav that enables you to visit three continents (US, Europe, Asia) in an epic series that places equal weight on both disciplines. Unlike before, the excellent Crash Junctions are accessible from the off (previously, the PS2 version of B2 only made these available some way into the game), and in truth this has proven to be a masterstroke; we became so hooked on them we devoted more time to them than any other area of the game.    In pure single-player mode, Crash Junctions have been fleshed out to provide often quite lengthy sections, which you can approach in a number of different ways. The premise of causing the biggest pile-up possible remains your goal, but this time Criterion has thrown in a number of new features that add a tactical edge to the proceedings. Chief among them is the new Crashbreaker ability, which kicks in once you've clocked up a predetermined number of crashes, and allows you to effectively detonate your car and then steer it with mid-air aftertouch in the direction of your choice, either into the path of other oncoming vehicles or the other collectables lying around.    With a bit of luck and no small amount of skill you can often engineer situations whereby you can explode your car in the direction of previously unobtainable score multipliers, or possibly another explosion. On the downside, the game also places an evil score-halving Heartbreaker near to goodies, often reducing triumphant performances to a miserable total. In truth, such is Crash Junction's appeal, we'd gladly buy the game even if it consisted solely of this mode offline. Quite often we'd spend half an hour at a time solely attempting new ways to conquer a particular junction: to take the boost or not, which angle to take ramp at and so on - and on top of that it's a beautiful visual spectacle with stupendous use of slow motion, only slightly marred by the lack of a more spectacular replay, or the ability to switch camera angles during it.    In offline multiplayer it's possibly even more riotous, allowing for the genius two player co-op Team Crush where you have to work together to cause even more insanity and the versus Double Impact mode, while Party Crash allows up to eight players to take it in turns on any of the unlocked junctions.    Racing is just as much carnage as it ever was, and in fact has been ramped up to include six drivers in the race from the off, as opposed to the four of previous versions. Knowing full well that online play would be full of idiots driving the wrong way and trying to be annoying as they always tend to do in online racing games, Criterion struck upon the realisation that basing the entire racing mode on the concept of 'takedowns' would solve this annoyance.    Stuck for a 'language of crashes' Criterion has taken inspiration from Tony Hawks and SSX with each successful takedown given its own specific name, such as 'Wall Takedown' or 'Psyche Out', while each track gives opportunities to come up with your own Signature Takedown, for example sending your opponent down a cliff side or other unique, one-off spectaculars. Boost, as ever, is a key part of the proceedings, and can be gained from the usual dangerous manoeuvres that previous players will be well and truly familiar with, like driving into oncoming traffic.   <a href=\" https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_burnout3_x\"><i>Taken from Eurogamer</i></a>",

  "gameName": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic",
  "tagline": "Choose your path",
  "blurb": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing video game set in the Star Wars universe. Developed by BioWare and published by LucasArts, the game was released for the Xbox on July 19, 2003, and for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2003. The game was later ported to Mac OS X, iOS, and Android by Aspyr, and it is playable on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One via their respective backward compatibility features.    The story of Knights of the Old Republic takes place almost 4,000 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire, where Darth Malak, a Dark Lord of the Sith, has unleashed a Sith armada against the Republic. The player character, as a Jedi, must venture to different planets in the galaxy to defeat Malak. Players choose from three character classes (Scout, Soldier or Scoundrel) and customize their characters at the beginning of the game, and engage in round-based combat against enemies. Through interacting with other characters and making plot decisions, players can earn Light Side and Dark Side Points, and the alignment system will determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of the Force.   <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "We're going on a little historical diversion in a second, so if you're just here for an opinion take this one and run. \"Knights of the Old Republic is the best Star Wars game since X-Wing and/or Tie Fighter, if not ever. Unless something entirely unbelievable descends from the heavens, it's the RPG of the year. If the remaining major players fumble even slightly, it's game of the year. Along with Halo, it's the reason to invite Bill Gates into your house\". Got that? Great.    Star Wars is enough to drive any fair-minded observer of popular culture insane. I sit in horror, watching otherwise sane-minded individuals wander out of the latest cinematic monstrosity cursing George Lucas' name only to - a handful of months later - go out and buy the DVD anyway \"for the extras\". You scratch your head at the AintItFatFacedAmericansInTheirBasements somehow claiming the original trilogy were the high points of cinematic history, when only Empire stands up as anything more than campy high adventure and Jedi is covered in a frankly embarrassing Ewokitis. And you grit your teeth as reviewer after reviewer adds twenty percent to a game's score because it’s got Stormtroopers and the real Lightsabre sound effects.    In short: I hate Star Wars.    The irony is before LucasArts lost anyone with a designer's brain in the company, they made some frankly astonishing videogames (It's probably difficult to recall post-Force-Commander et al, but in that early nineties period literally no other developer/publisher put out as many genuine classic games). Because I love videogames, I love the great Star Wars games that came from this period, because they’re great videogames - not because they're from that Galaxy a Long, Long way away.    Loving Star Wars games is nothing new. However, Knights of the Old Republic goes further into entirely unprecedented terrain.    It's made me love Star Wars. I care about the Sith and the Jedi. I care about the fate of Tatooine. I care about the plight of the Sand People. I care about Wookiees who've submitted to their rage. I care about the Mandaloreans, the Twi'lek and the Mon Calamari, and can even tell the difference between their funny shaped bodies (And thanks to KOTOR, I even know what real Star Wars fans are going to nit-pick about in the previous sentence). I care about all those guys.    In short, Knights of the Old Republic takes something that's been merchandised, franchised and branded to death over the last twenty-five years and makes it magical again.    It feels more like Star Wars than anything else has in living memory, and does so by moving the focus back four thousand years. And - would you believe it - things are very much as they are in the \"contemporary\" Star Wars universe. This gives the game the strength of familiarity of theme, a mythic arc as you realise you're rooting around in the prehistory of the world and due to distance from the actual films, freedom to create a plot as galaxy-spanning as anything that was committed to celluloid. Joy-bandits wishing to run off with your happiness to the hills to spend on moonshine may comment that the fact so little has changed in the period to be unbelievable. At which point, simply reply \"Well - it's Star Wars, idiot. It’s a Science Fantasy, not science fact and reliant on a world where technologies have been existent for long enough to gain a legendary quality. So yay-sucks-boo, big-nose.\"    In terms of experience, essentially Knights of the Old Republic is the first successful Western-style console Role-Playing Game of the modern age. There have been attempts at it (Morrowind sticks out as a recent example) but they've been very much afterthoughts, little more than a PC game with the controls mapped onto a joypad. KOTOR isn't like that at all. KOTOR takes the design beliefs of the Western RPG form and then works out how to present them best for playing whilst sprawled on a sofa in your living room.    Most important thing here: they don't assume console players are dumb and want less than their PC-equipped friends. They give everything that you'd expect in the original Baldur's Gate (not Dark Alliance) games on a big beige box, just do it in a more appropriate form. This means that rather than indirectly controlling your party with a mouse, you directly manipulate your avatar with the rest of your team-mates trotting behind you.    The westernised RPG model differs from the eastern, as seen in such things as Final Fantasy, in several definitive ways. Mainly, rather than following a relatively linear path, you're given a degree of freedom. Your character may have a destiny, but the details are very much your own to create. For example, depending on how you choose to progress - either being nice or nasty, essentially - you can lean towards the light or dark sides of the force. It actually does pose moral dilemmas. Some evil actions are deeply attractive. Some are just utilitarian. Some acts of good are intrinsically very stupid indeed. All this adds to a game where you feel your actions have a direct effect on your experience and the experience of the world.    While offering more options than the average eastern RPG (i.e. there are some), character generation is kept stripped down, with a choice of sex and three possible classes. However, in terms of specialisation and personalisation, much more takes place in the game proper, though with plentiful options for those who can't be bothered with fiddling with statistics to sidestep the whole process and let the Xbox make the decisions. By its close, your character will be very much a reflection of what you want to be. Oh - and a Jedi.    However, your character is just one in a highly defined cast. Nine team-mates join you as you progress, any two of which can actually be with you \"in the field\" at any time. These vary wildly, from various strains of Jedi, to alien races to droids, thus offering a wide selection of abilities. However, that's just game mechanics - a hit aimed at the brains. Far more interesting is how these characters are turned into actual characters - an all the more powerful blow aimed at the heart. Beautifully written, carefully defined and memorable, this is a cast who engender sympathy and empathy. While actually talking to the characters to delve their nature is, wisely, optional, only the hardest-souled individual would avoid it. Everyone in the world will fall in love with Assassin/Translator droid HK-47 (In short: Imagine if CP-30 was a misanthrope who wanted to kill everyone), but you'll all find personal favourites. Ordo the towering Mandalore warrior's rambling tales of towering machismo makes him mine, and takes the unique prize of being the only videogame character to make me wish I was gay.    Away from the main cast, the rest of the universe is populated expertly with even the smallest characters being personalised enough to make exploring it a pleasure. Often minor characters are embroiled in plentiful subplots, which provide mini-adventures away from the main thrust of the plot. Equally, the geezer who is from the same species as Yoda proves something we've always suspected about the Jedi Master of the films. Since this other guy can talk properly, the esteemed ancient trainer in fact actually does suffer a severe speech problem, thus proving the Jedi admirably unprejudiced in their recruitment policies.    Combat is similar to the Baldur's Gate games, in that you give orders to your individual characters who will then carry them out in a pseudo-real time manner. That is, there's all manner of calculations behind the scene, but you don't have to be party to them. Equally, you have the option of pausing time at any point to alter your tactics and try something else. Thermic Detonators are always a good one.    KOTOR is, however, far from perfect. Luckily, its failings are all too forgivable in the context of its epic sweep. There's a handful of genuine bugs. The frame-rate occasionally drops, which is a minor problem since the game isn't dependent on being an action game. Towards the end, when you’re leading a team of Jedi, combat can become somewhat easy on all but the hardest difficulty levels. There's more dialogue than you're probably used to, but it's linked to your decisions rather than thrown at you in endless cut-scenes, is performed by quality voice-actors and is as much as part of its strength as its weakness.    Failings, sure. But you really won't care.    So where does that leave us? Oh yes.    Knights of the Old Republic is the best Star Wars game since X-Wing and/or Tie Fighter, if not ever. Unless something entirely unbelievable descends from the heavens, it’s the RPG of the year. If the remaining major players fumble even slightly, it’s game of the year. Along with Halo, it’s the reason to invite Bill Gates into your house.    Got that? Great.

But you want to make sure that you follow the game around all its twists and turns, scooping all of those nutty experiences out of the bottom of the jar. So in reviewing XCOM 2 two years ago, I resorted to save-scumming — meticulously saving my game before every battle and painstakingly retracing my steps when something went wrong on a mission.    Not only is that the wrong way to play War of the Chosen, but it very nearly spoiled the game for me. That’s because this time around the team at Firaxis is leaning into the pain and the hardship inherent in its game.    I’m not saying that waging a guerrilla war against a superior foe from the bowels of a beat-up old airship was easy the first time around. But War of the Chosen has transformed XCOM 2 into a taut, nearly roguelike experience. It’s simply not the same game anymore.    In War of the Chosen, death is not the end. I know that now, and that’s why I’m starting over from the beginning.    War of the Chosen is effectively a total conversion for XCOM 2, but the core of the original game is still there. This is clear from the opening cinematic, which leads into the game’s original opening CGI sequence and tutorial battle. What Firaxis has done is grafted a number of key additions onto an already excellent experience. The DLC fully delivers on its promise with new mechanics to learn, new factions to befriend and deadly new enemies to fight against.    There are the Reapers, a friendly group of ranged fighters that are focused on stealth. The starting character, Elena Dragunova, comes equipped with a scoped carbine. She’s just as deadly as any Sharpshooter and stealthier by half. She’s able to take one or more actions, including shooting at and killing aliens, before she leaves concealment. Out of the box, she is instantly the best recon fighter that XCOM has ever had. And that’s before you get to level her up and gain new powers over time.    Another new face is Pratal Mox. He’s the first member of the friendly Skirmisher faction that you’ll meet. The Skirmishers are genetically engineered humans, members of the Advent military that have defected and thrown in their lot with XCOM. Mox has a grapple that he can use to reach high places, or to pull enemies toward him for a vicious melee strike. His bullpup rifle is also able to fire twice in one round, making him a nimble flanker.    Over and above these new factions, where War of the Chosen excels is in bringing characters to the fore. Dragunova is voiced by Marina Sirtis, who played Counsellor Troi on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Performing Mox is Michael Dorn, who played Lieutenant Commander Worf. In fact, War of the Chosen boasts performances from no fewer than five members of the original cast of TNG, including Jonathan Frakes (Commander William T. Riker), John de Lancie (Q) and Denise Crosby (Security Chief Tasha Yar).    This isn’t just a sentimental reunion for reunion’s sake. All of the actors do an excellent job of pushing the storyline forward.    Oh, by the way ... there’s a much meatier story now.    The original XCOM 2 was a sort of race against the clock to prevent the Advent project from getting off the ground. But, truth be told, it never felt like all that much of a threat. Sure, the Avatar project’s progress meter would move along every once in awhile, but it didn’t feel like anything was really happening when it did.    This time, sitting on your heels is simply not an option. Every mission is important, and every mission has the risk of being especially deadly thanks to the Chosen.    In the Alien Hunters DLC, Firaxis dreamed up a set of powerful boss aliens that would harass players across multiple missions. In War of the Chosen, they’ve amped that idea up a notch by borrowing from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system.    As you do battle against the Chosen, their skills improve, making them more and more dangerous over time. The result is that there are now four different timers ticking down, one for the Avatar project and one for each of the Chosen left alive. They are as aggressive as they are cunning; I have absolutely grown to hate them, and that’s something that I love.    War of the Chosen also introduces Bonds. When XCOM operatives go on missions together they grow closer, and formal Bonds allow them to grant each other perks during a mission. Of course, should a bondmate die or get captured (which is also a thing that can happen now, necessitating rescue missions), the survivor will receive an emotional scar that will decrease their combat effectiveness in the future.    As if that weren’t enough, there’s also a new enemy type: the Lost, a zombie-like race of mutated humans that crop up in certain areas around the map. Some missions focus on the Lost, with Left 4 Dead-style last-ditch standoffs and running gun battles through the streets. At other times, the Lost just get tossed into the mix randomly. You’ll be trying to destroy an objective as quietly as possible to keep them from streaming onto the map, where they cause chaos by attacking Advent and XCOM forces alike.    All of these factors — the new factions, the excellent voice acting, the soldier Bonds, the Lost and the new and dynamic mission types — combine to create more drama than ever before.    But you won’t see that drama if you coddle your soldiers with save-scumming, like I did. This time around, the game’s Iron Man mode — which literally prevents you from saving the game on your own — is absolutely necessary. It’s the only way to be sure that there’s the opportunity to lose the game.    I call it an opportunity because in XCOM 2: War of the Chosen, fighting a losing battle might be just as much fun as fighting and winning. It will hurt, and my favorite soldiers will die. But when I’m done I’ll have a much, much more interesting story to tell.    XCOM 2: War of the Chosen combines the rock-solid strategy core that the series has always been known for with a bundle of great quality-of-life improvements — the ability to preview possible targets ahead of your movement action, improved load times and more voice-over than ever before. It’s an experience that’s unmatched in the tactical strategy genre and, indeed, in the past games of this very series. I can say with confidence that XCOM 2: War of the Chosen is the definitive XCOM experience.   <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/24/16193192/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review\"><i>Taken from Polygon</i></a>",

  "blurb": "Halo: Reach is a 2010 first-person shooter developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios, originally for the Xbox 360. The fifth installment in the Halo series and a direct prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved, Reach was released worldwide in September 2010. The game takes place in the year 2552, where humanity is locked in a war with the alien Covenant. Players control Noble Six, a member of an elite supersoldier squad, when the human world known as Reach falls under Covenant attack.    After releasing Halo 3 in 2007, Bungie split into teams to develop two different games—what would become Halo 3: ODST and Reach. The developers decided to create a prequel to the original Halo game trilogy, freeing themselves from the obligation of addressing old story threads. As the game would take place on a human world doomed to be destroyed, they focused on making the environment a character unto itself. Longtime Halo composers Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori returned to compose Reach's music, aiming for a more somber sound to match the story.   <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Reach\"><i>Taken from Wikipedia</i></a>",
  "review": "I literally cackled the first time I fired a sniper rifle in Halo: Reach's PC multiplayer. Two shots, two kills, heavy caliber rounds crossing the map and cracking skulls as casually as you'd order off a drink menu. In the thousands of hours of Halo I've played on consoles in the last 15 years, I've never been a good sniper. With a controller, a headshot was a minor miracle. With a mouse, I point at the thing I want to die, and it obliges. But the same goes for everyone. Playing Halo: Reach on PC is like bringing death lasers to a fight designed for blunderbusses.    Is this what the weapons and maps and abilities were designed around? Hell no. Is it balanced? Absolutely not. But now I never want to play Halo any other way.    Halo: Reach was made for the Xbox 360 in 2010, and nine years later it's the first part of the Master Chief Collection, an anthology spanning the Halo series, to arrive on PC. Playing it again for the first time in many years, I think it's still a shooter worth experiencing in 2019. The campaign, which lasts for six hours or so, sticks closely to the formula that makes Halo great. Each mission threads together big, open-ended combat encounters against an endlessly killable group of enemies with a freedom still rare in shooters.    Sometimes I'll go out of my way to kick a puny Grunt out of his Ghost, a one person anti-grav vehicle with a nasty pair of laser cannons, just so I can use it to run over his friends. Other times I'll hang back and use a rifle to pick off Jackals, who crouch behind defensive shields, by shooting them in the hand and then in the head, the most satisfying two-shot kill in videogames. There's fun to be had even with puny weapons like the needler, which home in and lodge in flesh until they explode, killing anyone foolish enough to stand nearby.    The real threats are the Elites and the Brutes, whose AI can occasionally still be intimidating today. They'll dodge grenades and try to get around behind you, and killing them first has many advantages. It'll stop them from rushing you for a deadly melee, and their Grunt escorts will sometimes even flee in terror when you take them down. But they're shielded and much harder to kill, so focusing on them can be dangerous when you're being peppered with shield-draining fire from the Grunts and Jackals in their squads.    I've probably killed tens of thousands of Elites in my life, but in Reach I still loved tracking them with my rifle and ping ping pinging them with bullets until their shields popped, then delivering those final killing bullets to their heads and watching them crumple. Reach is also constantly offering other ways to make that kill: a shotgun that you pull out when an Elite charges right at you with a roar, or an energy weapon that drains their shields far faster than bullets, or a warthog that turns them into roadkill.    In most shooters it's fun to switch weapons to decide what kind of carnage you want to dish out in the moment, or what works best against a particular enemy. That's true in Halo, too—but because you can only carry two weapons at a time, and you don't have a permanent arsenal the way you do in a game like Doom, every mission is a series of on-the-fly adaptations. I'm constantly analyzing the most efficient or creative ways to work with what's around me. In one tough firefight against two squads of Brutes, I made a beeline for one of the leaders, killed him before the rest caught up, grabbed his massive hammer, and smashed the hell out of everybody else. The freedom of every encounter is key to why Halo's enemies are still fun to shoot, even though they haven't changed much over almost 20 years.    The best Halo missions weave together open areas and vehicle segments with close quarters battles, alternating between setpieces and smaller moments. In most Halo games, there are one or two missions that string together all of these pieces and really stand out. But in Reach, that's most of the campaign, and there isn't a single bad mission in the entire bunch. There's no fat on this game.    The story, which puts you in the armor of a new member of an elite Spartan squad, gives you sketches of personalities rather than the sense that you truly know the characters you're fighting alongside. You know which Spartan is the tough guy, for instance, because he's always playing with his knife (and he has a skull carved into the visor of his helmet). Reach tries really hard for poignant, sentimental moments as members of your squad die, with a sad piano score for every tragedy. But we don't get to spend enough time with any of them to really feel the gut punch.    Still, Reach does feel remarkably somber, which is hard to pull off in a bombastic action game about shooting aliens. The campaign is about those aliens, the Covenant, invading a vital human world and slowly destroying it, despite everything you throw at them. Every mission you complete ends with success—saving a naval base, destroying a Covenant supercarrier, evacuating civilians from a besieged city—and is then immediately undercut. As that ship explodes, a dozen more warp into orbit to shell the planet. After you fight to save the city, a nuke obliterates it.    It's hard to make a hopeless war fun to play, but Reach leaves a heavier emotional imprint than most shooters I've played. The only one that comes to mind that does it better is 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order.    After experiencing the story, I'm already eager to jump back into my favorite campaign levels with 4-player co-op, and so far my experience playing online, both in co-op and competitive multiplayer, has been great. The Master Chief Collection uses dedicated servers, and I've experienced almost no lag in the 10 hours or so of multiplayer I've played. The game feels smooth, even in the co-op Firefight mode, which, like the campaign, requires the game to keep track of dozens of AI units at once.    Back on the Xbox 360, without dedicated servers, this mode was almost unplayable online. Today, on PC, it's practically indistinguishable from playing solo. Dedicated servers make a huge difference.    So does the performance of a modern gaming PC. On my system with an i7-6700K and a GTX 980, Reach ran at over 200 fps at 1440p resolution. By default, the game is set to 60 fps, and there are still some issues with its unlocked framerate. With VSync off, Reach has distracting screen tearing unless you own a G-Sync or FreeSync monitor. Even with G-Sync on, I experienced a very rare stutter that I initially thought was the campaign loading, until it happened in multiplayer. It's a minor enough issue to barely register for me, and the developers have already acknowledged they're working on improvements to the unlocked framerate implementation. They've said the same for Reach's audio mix, which is unfortunately poor and sounds a bit muffled on PC.    Again, though, it didn't stop me from having fun with the game—playing with headphones and adjusting the audio balance to bring voices and sound effects up over music, I didn't have a problem hearing what I needed to.    Ultimately the issues with Halo: Reach on Steam wash away the moment I start aiming with a mouse. Halo multiplayer on PC is fundamentally different than it is on consoles—with mouse aim, accurate long-range weapons like the DMR really dominate maps. Most of the guns become irrelevant. And Reach's other issues from 2010 remain: Halo has always had the DNA of an arena shooter, where everyone is on equal footing and controlling the map is key to victory. Reach added \"armor abilities\" like sprint and invisibility and a hologram decoy, and weapon loadouts that change your starting firearms. Neither makes the game more fun to play, and they're definitely not fun to play against when you expect to be on even footing. They're why Reach's multiplayer is probably my least favorite in the series, overall.    But playing it now on PC, I'm finding armor abilities and loadouts don't bother me nearly as much as they once did because the basic gunplay is so satisfying with a mouse—Reach is more fun than ever with pinpoint accuracy, and the enhanced power of a basic rifle minimizes the effect of those balance issues.     As the Master Chief Collection expands, I expect I'll play Reach less and the first three Halos more. They all have great selections of multiplayer maps, and more importantly, the simplicity of no armor abilities and no loadouts. But it's exciting to come back to Reach after nearly a decade and find its multiplayer more fun than ever, in a port that bodes well for the rest of the series.   <a href=\" https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/halo-reach-review/\"><i>Taken from PCGamer</i></a>",
